description: Protagonist Dennis Fleet yearns not only for the hand of Christine Ludolph,
  but also for her soul, since she is a non-believer. The beautiful Christine looks
  down on Dennis and toys with his feelings, for in her eyes he has nothing to compare
  to her refined European background. But the fire eventually fixes everything, revealing
  to Christine Dennis's higher nobility and converting her both to him and his God.
  Dennis, who has just witnessed the death of Christine's father when Baron Ludolph
  foolishly tried to save valuable papers from his downtown art gallery, makes his
  way to the North Division in order to find Christine.
